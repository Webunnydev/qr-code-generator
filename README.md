## Description

The QR Code Generator is a web application that allows users to generate QR codes for URLs. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface to quickly create QR codes and download them for personal or business use.

The application uses Node.js on the server side to handle requests, and a QR code generation library to generate the QR codes dynamically. It also saves the URL of the QR code to a text file.
